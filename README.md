# Light in the Iron Cage
Light in the Iron Cage was created for the purpose of glorifying God and pointing the suffering to Him. As one who was formerly despairing in an [Iron Cage](https://kenpulsmusic.com/pilgrimsprogress28.html), I want to point others like me towards the healing light of Jesus through the Holy Spirit. I pray that you would be pointed to the kindness of Christ here.

## Site Map
This blog is broken into four main types of posts: 
- The Pilgrim's Log: where I talk about living the Christian life.
- The Library: where I talk about literature and books.
- The Ensemble: where I talk about music.
- The Cinema: where I talk about movies, tv, and anime.

Take a look around!
