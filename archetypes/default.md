> "But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."  
> -- **2 Peter 3:13**

> "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.
>
> Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same."  
> -- **C.S. Lewis**
