_That Hideous Strength_ is a unique, compelling, and haunting book. It's one of my favorites. I love basically anything and everything that C.S. Lewis has written, but this last book in his "Ransom (or Space) Trilogy" is perhaps one of, if not the most, dark and thought-provoking. You don't *need* to have read the first two books in the trilogy to understand this one, but I would obviously recommend it.

It is a dystopian science fiction novel about the dangers of a 'modernized' society attempting to use science, philosophy, sociology, and even demonic influence to achieve power over the world and transcend their own humanity in a final rejection of God. 

It was published in 1945 and and yet it is not dated in the slightest - in fact - it's borderline prophetic. If you take a good look around at our world today and then examine Lewis's society ruled by the N.I.C.E. - the "National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments", you will not see much of a difference. 

Even during Lewis's day such a world seemed to be just on the horizon. Consider these words from George Orwell who created the infamous "Big Brother" in _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ just four years after Lewis wrote _That Hideous Strength_: 
> "Plenty of people in our age do entertain the monstrous dreams of power that Mr Lewis attributes to his characters [the N.I.C.E. scientists], and **we are within sight of the time when such dreams will be realizable**." (emphasis mine)     
> -- George Orwell, Review of That Hideous Strength

That is utterly terrifying...and why it is a good book.

Science fiction is one of my favorite genres because it forces all of us to really ponder what we humans actually are and how it can be marred. _Star Trek_ for instance is a great example of how technology can act as a good gift from God to help mankind. _Blade Runner_ poses the question of what makes us human at all compared to androids. _Terminator_ highlights the dangers of giving AI too much power. _Brave New World_ depicts a society enslaved to pleasure.

We in modern society have medicines and doctors and AI and computers to help us live life. These are good things if used rightly, but like anything good, it can be twisted. Technology in particular can be bent into something very very inhuman. 
- A moderate use of medicine for pain relief can turn into a crippling opiate addiction that can kill you. 
- An innocent love of a YouTube channel can morph into a parasocial one-sided friendship with it's creator. 
- A slight feeling of boredom can be squashed with hours of endless scrolling that you don't even remember. 
- A normal use of AI can turn into an obsessive relationship with a chatbot that can replace a human relationship. 
- A deep loneliness can be medicated with the dark fantasy and perversions of pornography with anyone or anything - real or created, flesh or machine.  

I'm a software developer. I went to school for computer science. Technology is not evil, it is simply a powerful tool. Therein lies the problem - powerful tools are often abused. In the hands of sinful man technology can not only be used to commit great evil, but create new evil like never before. That is scary.

You get the idea. There are far too many themes within _That Hideous Strength_ to go over, so I just wanted to highlight some of my favorites to get you interested in reading it for yourself:

On good vs evil, 
> "“If you dip into any college, or school, or parish, or family – anything you like – at a given point in its history, you always find that there was a time before that point when there was more elbow room and contrasts weren’t quite so sharp; and that there’s going to be a time after that point when there is even less room for indecision and choices are even more momentous. 
> 
> Good is always getting better and bad is always getting worse: the possibilities of even apparent neutrality are always diminishing. The whole thing is sorting itself out all the time, coming to a point, getting sharper and harder.”"  

On politics, 
> "“Don't you understand anything? Isn't it absolutely essential to keep a fierce Left and a fierce Right both on their toes and each terrified of the other? That's how we get things done. Of course we're non-political. The real power always is.”

On social engineering, 
> "“We want you to write it down--to camouflage it. Only for the present, of course. Once the thing gets going we shan't have to bother about the great heart of the British public. We'll make the great heart what we want it to be. But in the meantime, it does make a difference how things are put. For instance, if it were even whispered that the N.I.C.E. wanted powers to experiment on criminals, you'd have all the old women of both sexes up in arms and yapping about humanity. Call it re-education of the mal-adjusted, and you have them all slobbering with delight that the brutal era of retributive punishment has at last come to and end. Odd thing it is--the word 'experiment' is unpopular, but not the word 'experimental.' You must'nt experiment on children; but offer the dear little kiddies free education in an experimental school attached to the N.I.C.E. and it's all correct!”"  

On sin (specifically lust),
> "“It is idle to point out to the perverted man the horror of his perversion: while the fierce fit is on, that horror is the very spice of his craving. It is ugliness itself that becomes, in the end, the goal of his lechery; beauty has long since grown too weak a stimulant.”"

On the abuse of science,
> "“The physical sciences, good and innocent in themselves, had already... begun to be warped, had been subtly manoeuvred in a certain direction. Despair of objective truth had been increasingly insinuated into the scientists; indifference to it, and a concentration upon mere power, had been the result… The very experiences of the dissecting room and the pathological laboratory were breeding a conviction that the stifling of all deep-set repugnances was the first essential for progress.”"

On nihilism,
> "“Wither knew that everything was lost. It is incredible how little this knowledge moved him. What had been in his far-off youth a merely aesthetic repugnance to realities that were crude or vulgar, had deepened and darkened, year after year, into a fixed refusal of everything that was in any degree other than himself. He had passed from Hegel into Hume, thence through Pragmatism, and thence through logical Positivism, and out at last into the complete void. The indicative mood now corresponded to no thought that his mind could entertain. He had willed with his whole heart that there should be no reality and no truth, and now even the imminence of his own ruin could not wake him.”"

On transhumanism,
> ""But I tell you I have seen the civilized tree in Persia. It was a French attaché who had it made because he was in a place where trees do not grow. It was made of metal. A poor, crude thing. But how if it were perfected? Light, made of aluminum. So natural it would even deceive."
>
> "It would hardly be the same as a real tree," said Winter.
> 
> "But consider the advantages! You get tired of him in one place: two workmen carry him somewhere else: wherever you please. It never dies. No leaves to fall, no twigs, no birds building nests, no muck and mess."
>
> "What are you driving at, Professor?” said Gould. "After all we are organisms ourselves."
>
> "I grant it. That is the point. In us organic life has produced Mind. It has done its work. After that we want no more of it. We do not want the world any longer furred over with organic life, like what you call the blue mould—all sprouting and budding and breeding and decaying. We must get rid of it. By little and little, of course. Slowly we learn how. Learn to make our brains live with less and less body: learn to build our bodies directly with chemicals, no longer have to stuff them full of dead brutes and weeds.""

Again, that is just a sample. There is so much more in this book. Please consider checking it out if you have not. In this day and age we need to. May God keep us in His loving arms and not leave us ensnared by the cold machines.
