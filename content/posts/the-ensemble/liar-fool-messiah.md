Theocracy is one of my very favorite bands of all time due to their beautiful sound and powerful lyrics. The song "Liar, Fool, or Messiah", is a reference to C.S. Lewis's [trilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma) and one of the most excellent logical arguments for the legitimacy of Christianity. 

The words and claims of Jesus of Nazareth are recorded for all humanity to read and respond to - He boldly claimed to be God and the Christ (Messiah). Lewis simply concludes that then He must either be: 1. Lying, 2. Delusional, or 3. Telling the truth.

Some also add a fourth option and claim that Jesus could also have been a 4. fabricated legend or story, but that argument collapses at even the most rudimentary inquiry into the historical reality of Jesus from multiple secular accounts, let alone the testimony of the Bible and other saints. 

Say what you want about Jesus, but this man existed and claimed to be God. We cannot not have an opinion on this such a person. 

If I go out into the world and encounter someone who introduces themselves as God very God who is above all, and created all, and is all powerful and eternal, I am going to think they are out of their mind or a devilish liar. I guarantee you that no rational person would (or should) wholeheartedly accept and believe anyone who claims such a thing. With this in mind, why did people believe Jesus? Why do I believe Jesus? Why should you also believe in Him?

I am a former agnostic and apostate of the Christianity that was saved after leaving for years. I know the temptation to simply throw up your hands and conclude that there is no way to know for sure if any religion is true, let alone the Christian faith or the words of Jesus. I get it; I really do. Questions of meaning, life, death, and truth are nontrivial matters of reality.

As a Christian, I obviously would argue that Jesus Christ was and is God for many reasons, but for this article I want to just specifically focus on Lewis's trilemma. 

It is interesting to me that even when I was an agnostic, I would have never said that Jesus was a liar nor a fool. I thought in general either Christianity was entirely false or that it was entirely true but I was excluded from the comfort it claimed. Jesus Himself in the Bible never seemed like a deceiver or out of His mind. Many of my questions remained questions simply because I did not want to think about them. Who Jesus claimed to be was not really in question.

For me there was too much evidence that Christianity was true for me to declare that it was outright false, but there was also much I could also try and point to as proof it was (at least for me specifically). This is why at this time I viewed myself as an agnostic, not an atheist. This however, was a grave error. 

To say "I don't know", is to make a choice just as certain as saying "I don't believe" or "I do believe." As Rush declared in "Freewill",

Looking back, I must confess that my answer to the trilemma was "liar". Even though I never verbally declared it, my belief and actions reflected it. I thought that either the Bible/Christianity was not true (lie) or that I was exempt from it's promises (lie) or had lost my salvation (lie) or that God hated me (lie). See a pattern here? I clearly answered the question because every single person must (and does) ultimately have an answer.

A Christian says "Lord". An atheist says "liar", "fool", or "legend". An agnostic may say "unknown/unknowable", but in reality that is the same exact answer of an atheist - they just haven't decided on which variant or are avoiding the question entirely.

As Theocracy said,

I'm not trying to step on toes here. I'm really not; I was an agnostic myself. I still to this day struggle with deep doubt and unbelief even as a Christian. I am simply trying to argue that everyone should at a bare minimum read the Bible, see what it says about Jesus, and make a conclusion about Him. Every one of us must all answer Jesus' question: "But who do you say that I am?" (Matthew 16:15)

Seek to know who He was and is. All of life, death, and reality is changed if He really is who He says he is. It is terrifying. It is also life-changing. You will find Him and He will find you if you but look. (Jeremiah 29:13, Matthew 11:28-30, Hebrews 13:8, Revelation 3:20)

> “I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice.

> Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.
