> “I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 
I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. 
That is the one thing we must not say. 
A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. 
He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. 
You must make your choice.

You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher.

Lewis's Trilemma is an excellent argument because it forces all of us to look at what Jesus claimed and make a logical conclusion. 
The words and claims of Jesus of Nazareth are recorded in the New Testament for all humanity to read and respond to: He boldly claimed to be God and the Christ (Messiah). 
As Lewis concludes, He is either lying, delusional, or telling the truth.
Some have also claim that Jesus also could have been a fabricated legend, but that argument collapses at even the most rudimentary inquiry into the historical reality of Jesus from multiple accounts, let alone the Bible.

Say what you want about Jesus, but this man existed and claimed to be God. 
We cannot not have an opinion on this person. 
If I go out into the world and start introducing myself as God, you are going to conclude I am completely insane or an evil liar. 
I guarantee you that no one would believe me.
So why did people believe Jesus? 

I am a former agnostic and apostate of the Christianity that was saved after leaving for years.
I know the temptation to simply throw up your hands and conclude that there is no way to know for sure if any religion is true, let alone the Christian faith or the words of Jesus.
I get it. 
I really do. 
Questions of meaning, life, death, and truth are nontrivial matters of reality.

As a Christian, I obviously would argue that Jesus Christ was and is God. 
However, it is interesting to me that even when I was an agnostic I never once (per my recollection) came to the conclusion that Jesus' words were the claims of a liar nor of a fool. 
I thought in general either Christianity was entirely false or that it was entirely true but I was excluded from the comfort it claimed. 
Many of my questions remained questions simply because I did not think about them. 
There was too much evidence that Christianity was true for me to say that it was false, but there was also much I could also try and point to as proof it was false.
This is why at this time I viewed myself as an agnostic, not an atheist.

This however, is a grave error. To say "I don't know", is to make a choice just as certain as saying "I don't believe" or "I do believe."

Please read the Bible and see who Jesus Christ is. 
Every one of us must all answer Jesus' question: "But who do you say that I am?" (Matthew 16:15) 
Seek to know who He was and is. 
All of life, death, and reality is changed if He is who He says he is.
You will find Him and He will find you if you look. (Jeremiah 29:13, Revelation 3:20)
