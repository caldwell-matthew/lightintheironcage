> Have you ever thought about your soul  
> Can it be saved?  
> Or perhaps you think  
> That when you are dead  
> You just stay in your grave  
> Is God just a thought within your head  
> Or is he a part of you?  
> Is Christ just a name  
> That you read in the book  
> When you were in school?
