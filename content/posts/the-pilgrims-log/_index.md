I talk about living the Christian life here.

> O despairing one, turn in here.  
> This is a place you need not fear.
> 
> I, like you, have known such sorrow.  
> Many nights I have wished for no tomorrow.
> 
> Once in that iron cage my soul did lay.  
> The God of loving light broke in one day.
> 
> Look to Him I say! Father, Son, and Spirit three.  
> He will surely save you. Yes, even thee.
> 
> Weary sinner, run to Jesus the gentle One.  
> He shall never cast away a soul undone.
> 
> I hear you cry, 'But will He love me? Even the vilest of all?'  
> Yes, He will! O my despairing friend.
> 
> I know this truly; for He saved even me.  
> -- One Once Despairing
