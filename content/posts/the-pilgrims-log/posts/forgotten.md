I confess that I often feel forgotten. Like many before me such as Israel, many of the Psalmists, and even Jesus Himself, I lament, “'Why have You forsaken me?'" “Why have You forgotten me?” “Why do I feel abandoned, forgotten, and alone?”

I’m sure that you have felt like this too for whatever reason. A deep loss, a sudden affliction, an overwhelming sin, unanswered prayer, anything and everything can cause us to feel abandoned by God and question where He is and what He is doing. 

I’m not going to pretend that I have an easy answer to such suffering because I simply don't have one. I just don't. Sadly, life is full of suffering and this side of eternity we are most likely going to feel like this many many times until we are face to face with God. Faith is to hope in what we cannot immediately see or fully understand tangibly is it not? So what do we do? How do we exist and live when we feel abandoned on this planet? What comfort do we or can we have right now? 

One thing that we can hold on to is that no matter how forgotten, forsaken, and rejected by God we may feel, He has promised to remember us. He has promised He loves us, cares for us, and will not forget us. We are not forgotten. Not one. 

It's easy (at least for me) to dismiss platitudes like this and doubt that you yourself are among those whom God remembers. It’s easy to wonder, “Yes, God will not forget the church and those whom He loves in general…but what about me specifically? Does He really see me? Does He really - to put it bluntly - think about me like that? Like how you would think about someone you love and are intimately acquainted with their life? Their joy, their suffering, their fear, their doubts and struggles? Does He really look at me like that with that much remembrance, care, and affection?”

No matter the person or depth of suffering, God does see you and will not forget you; no matter how forgotten you may feel. If He remembers the little sparrow, He certainly remembers little you. “Not one is forgotten.” He counts your very tears and every sleepless night. He even weeps with you in your suffering. He draws near to you. He looks at you in love, not away from you. He knows everything about you, your life, your pain, your sin and still loves you dearly like a comforting parent.

However, even if you feel no comfort from intellectually knowing this, rest in the fact that God does hear your cries of sorrow. He has never forgotten you even if you feel utterly forsaken. Rest in that even when nothing else in the whole world may comfort you. 
Forgotten we may feel, but forgotten we are not. 

> “But Zion said, “The Lord has forsaken me;
my Lord has forgotten me.”
“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb?
Even these may forget,
yet I will not forget you.
Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands;
your walls are continually before me.””  
> -- Isaiah 49:14-16

> “The Lord your God is in your midst,
a mighty one who will save;
he will rejoice over you with gladness;
he will quiet you by his love;
he will exult over you with loud singing.”  
> -- Zephaniah 3:17

> “Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.”

put my tears in your bottle.
Are they not in your book?”
