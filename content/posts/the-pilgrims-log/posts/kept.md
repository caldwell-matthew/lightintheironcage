Have you ever had something you got really invested in for a while only to abandon it later?

I certainly have. It’s trivially easy. Motivation fades, ideas are thrown out, books go unread, and discipline becomes inconsistent. I am naturally not a very stable or reliable or diligent person.

God however is not a fallible human like me, and therefore cannot be anything but absolutely consistent. This means that He is unchanging in His person, character, actions, and will. He is someone who finishes what He starts and does not procrastinate or leave a job unfinished. To our naked eye it may look like no progress is being made at all, but if God is the one working we can be sure that He will finish in His appointed timeframe.

This is difficult for me as someone who likes quick and instantaneous results. I want change and action now. I want problems fixed and sent away at once. I don't like having to "maintain" issues or problem-solve. I just want the issues gone as soon as possible. I don't want something to be a “work-in-progress”, I just want it “finished”. 

Sadly, in the day-to-day reality of sanctification that is not what we are living with. We are, in fact, walking and talking “works-in-progress” which is often maddening to me. God can do anything, so why on earth would He do something slowly? Not to mention the fact that most issues that we want done and dusted are issues of sin and suffering-why would God tarry and make such painful issues last any longer than needed?

I don't know for sure, but from the Bible we clearly see that whatever God chooses to start working on, He finishes it no matter what. He promises to save someone, He will. He says that He will heal you from a besetting sin, He will. He consoles that one day He will take us to be with Him, He will. He promises to do many things and being God, He will and must follow through no matter any hindrance. This means nothing can thwart His intentions and plans. 

He will never give up. He will never abandon. He will never walk away when a project is too hard or there are a certain number of setbacks or new issues. He will work tirelessly to finish what He has started: to love, save, and change sinners. We ultimately are not the ones working, He is. We just need to trust His processes even when they seem painfully slow. 

He will never finish His work until the moment we see Him as He says, “Welcome Home.”
