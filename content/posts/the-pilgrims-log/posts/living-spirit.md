In many places the Bible gives a grim prognosis of humanity: we are dead. Of course, not yet physically - but spiritually and relationally dead to God. As Paul said multiple times, we stand “dead in our trespasses and sins” before a holy and living God.

To state the brutally obvious, this is a problem. 

We are dead men walking on this earth spirituality and one day will die physically and unless something changes we will be dead forever apart from God. We are born dead, and if we die in this state, we will be eternally dead. 

The solution then is simple, but not simple at all - the dead need to be made alive. Like a heart attack patient, we need resuscitation and life breathed into us before we die on the table. The heart of stone needs to be broken and begin to beat into life. The sinner needs a complete remaking and restoration of himself. In fact, he needs to be made something different altogether. Simple cleaning and tidying up will not do at all. We need to be changed, reborn, and recreated. A complete metamorphosis is needed. The dead sinner cannot be “cleaned up” just like putting lipstick on a pig cannot make it a woman. All you are accomplishing is a superficial outer change. It still is what it is. The problem is that the sinner is a dead man and the pig is still a pig. 

This is why morality will never bring you closer to heaven. To enter heaven you need to be made alive to God through Christ alone. A dead man doing good things (or bad) is still just a corpse. God ultimately does not care how many good or bad things you did with your life if you never knew Him at all and are still dead. His main question is this: are you dead in sin or alive in His Son? Heaven is only for the spiritually alive in Christ; why would He let in a dead man He has never known and that never called out to Him?

I touched on it already, but how then are we made alive? God makes us alive. A dead man cannot start his own heart again to life. The caterpillar cannot turn itself into a butterfly. The sinner cannot be born again by his own will and power. God must do it. Eustace Scrubb cannot shed his own dragon skin, and Edmund Pevensie cannot escape the white witch’s execution. It must be Aslan who does it for them. 

So we come to faith in Christ yes, but only because we are drawn to faith in Him by Him and are saved. It is hard to determine *exactly* when exactly a person is saved and made alive, but I believe it is the moment when God the Father, through the Holy Spirit’s conviction of sin, directs the sinner to fly to Jesus Christ and grab hold of Him by faith. In that moment, the sinner is saved, born again, and made spiritually alive to God. A person may slowly grow into more mature faith, but that instance is the spark of life.
Now that the sinner is made spiritually alive, he can now begin to actually live. Paul in Romans expounds this idea by declaring that our mortal bodies have been given new life through the Spirit even though the physical body is still dead and dying. God is now with us and in us. We are even called “temples of the Holy Spirit” and “partakers of the divine nature”. God is omnipresent but for the living believer He is directly in us too. 

This changes everything. A dead man cannot make himself alive to God, but as I said, one who is alive to God can actually live. What I mean is what Jesus stated as recorded in John’s gospel, “Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.” Life - temporal and eternal - is to know God. As we truly live by knowing and following God we must understand that it is still only God who made us alive and continues to keep us alive. He is the one loving us. He is the one changing us. He is the one keeping our soul alive to Him. We cannot do these things. We cannot live honoring and glorifying lives for God by ourselves. We cannot stop sinning unless He changes us and turns our heart to love and trust Him more than sin. We cannot do anything at all without God. If you try, you will find out very quickly that you cannot do the good you want and instead do what is evil. It is God who changes and strengthens us newly created people to follow Him.

What does this look like practically for you and me? It is simply a relational communication with this God who has chosen to love you. Listen to what He says in the Bible, and respond to Him in prayer while living life according to what He has said. It's that simple; but at the same time quite difficult. Confess your utter dependance on God by talking to Him, listening to Him, and relying on Him to love and change you as you walk upon this earth trying your best to follow and obey Him. Paul commands us to “work out your own salvation”: implying that we are responsible for how we are to live and change. However Paul follows up in the next verse with “for it is God who works in you”: implying that only God is the one responsible for changing us. 

Both are true. 

We are utterly dependent on God to save us and need Him to change us and enable us to live for Him. At the same time we are also called to put sin to death, fight the fight of faith, and beat our bodies into submission. We are to pursue sanctification and Christlikeness relentlessly - all the while knowing that it is ultimately God alone who justifies, sanctifies, and eventually glorifies a sinner trusting in Christ.

So in light of these things, live like one who has been made alive. We are no longer dead, our cancer of sin will one day be eradicated, and until then we must trust God and press on towards Him who invited us into Himself; eternally and happily alive.

> You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.

> For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot.

> Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.

> His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.  
> -- 2 Peter 1:3–4

> The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him.
