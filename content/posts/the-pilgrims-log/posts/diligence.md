God has revealed many different attributes and characteristics about Himself which at the same time oppositely highlight our sinfulness. We are not like God and He is not like us. As He has been described in many wonderful ways, we have been likewise humbled in a myriad of ways. A man will never know how ugly he is until he looks in a holy mirror. Every sin has its holy opposite found in God. 

God is humble, man is proud. Christ is pure, man is lustful. The Spirit is generous, man is greedy. These are all pretty self-explanatory…but what about the sin of laziness? What character of God is the antithesis of a sluggard?

I admit I was not actually 100% sure until I read Proverbs front to back and was given the answer: **diligence**. What is diligence? I’m sure you could describe it in multiple ways, but I would define it as “a faithful, determined, zealous, whole-hearted, strenuous, and consistently devoted effort towards a goal or project until completion”. It is the pure unrelenting force of focus upon its subject. It’s the olympic athlete that trains for 8 hours a day to win a gold medal. It's the student who studies day and night to get into Harvard. It’s the master craftsman who creates a work of art over weeks and weeks of tediously measuring, planning, and carving out a statue. It is God intricately creating the world and ourselves. It is God being the author and sustainer of our very faith. It is God being the grand author who has planned and predestined and written everything down. It is Jesus who excelled in carpentry to glorify His Father in diligent work. It is Jesus who set His face like a flint to come to the world and live every day towards one goal of saving the sinner. It is the Holy Spirit convicting the world and pursuing the lost. It is God being diligent, intentional, and focused toward a goal: glorifying Himself and saving the lost.
  
Everything that faithful diligence is, the slothful sluggard is not. Sloth cares not for diligence and hard work. He much prefers…well really anything so long as it demands nothing. He doesn't even want to commit to thinking about committing to anything at all. You will always see him wanting everything and yet nearly starving because of his refusal to get a piece of bread. He will always be poor because He cannot think about working with all these lions in the street. He has never had a goal in his life except to not have one. It would be far too much work otherwise. He can listlessly drift and ebb and bob away on his battered bed because his comfort is his god. Why would he make himself suffer through work or faithful effort? He has his own work to do: binge a show.

Proverbs shows us a far better life in the person of diligent wise lady Wisdom. She is always working toward something: be it work, finance, cultivation, anything and everything that can have faithful effort expended towards. Complacency has never defiled Her. She works and toils always to love her God and everyone else around her. 

Diligent work and service is ultimately a form of worshiping God by glorifying Him in the art of working by imitating His character. Adam and Eve were put in the garden to walk with God yes, but also to work by tending the garden. As I mentioned before Jesus before entering full time ministry was a carpenter. I am utterly convinced that anything that Jesus made was of exceptional quality. He was not lazy or haphazardly making things. How would that glorify His Father if He was? Paul was a tentmaker, Luke was a physician, many of the disciples were fishermen, the list goes on and on but the point is that work (specifically diligent and faithful work) is always a way to love God and others. Musicians spend innumerable hours perfecting a craft to play an instrument. Chefs cook a wide variety of food for years to feed the hungry and create food that goes beyond imagination. Writers pour their soul into a page and write for days to construct the perfect way to convey meaning. All of this physical work done in faith glorifies God. 

Spiritually it is even more important. We are called to be sober minded, work out our salvation, and seek God with our whole hearts. God is not interested in lackadaisical nor sleepy attempts to know Him. He wants our full love and diligent devotion. Remember when Jesus talked about the man who finds treasure in a field? Do you think that man was sluggish when he realized what he found? Of course not. He would deprive himself of food, drink, and rest working day and night to make enough money to afford the field and then excavate it from the ground to gain his prize. The woman who lost a coin and the shepherd who lost a sheep are diligently searching for what they lost. The father was looking for his prodigal son fervently. We likewise must be diligent not only with our pursuit of knowing God but also with attentive care for our souls. The sleeping servants who were shut out of the masters house because they were not diligently keeping their lamps prepared. In war, one must always be on the alert for the enemy and for God.

God is diligent in His purposes and most astonishingly His love. He is diligent in loving, saving, and doing good to us. How can we not be diligently pursuing Him? 

> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,  
> -- Colossians 3:23

> Through sloth the roof sinks in,and through indolence the house leaks.  
> -- Ecclesiastes 10:18

> and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.  
> -- 1 Thessalonians 4:11–12

> For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.  
> -- 2 Thessalonians 3:10

> so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.  
> -- Hebrews 6:12

> Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,  
but he who hates reproof is stupid.   
Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread,  
but he who follows worthless pursuits lacks sense.   
From the fruit of his mouth a man is satisfied with good,  
and the work of a man’s hand comes back to him.   
Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD,  
but those who act faithfully are his delight.  
A prudent man conceals knowledge,  
but the heart of fools proclaims folly.  
The hand of the diligent will rule,  
while the slothful will be put to forced labor.  
Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs him down,  
but a good word makes him glad.  
One who is righteous is a guide to his neighbor,  
but the way of the wicked leads them astray.  
Whoever is slothful will not roast his game,  
but the diligent man will get precious wealth.  
In the path of righteousness is life,  
and in its pathway there is no death.  
> -- Proverbs 12:1, 11, 14, 22–28
