In Proverbs, Solomon describes wisdom as better than great hoards of silver and gold - one of the most valuable things in life that money cannot buy. Likewise, peace is a rare gift that many strive after and rarely find. 

Some seek after world peace and protest war, injustice, and violence. Others may strive for relational peace between family, friends, or lovers. However despite all these “types” of peace being well and good, everyone ultimately wants inner peace with themselves. 

- A man may feel insecure and spend his entire life in a gym sculpting his body into an image that he is not ashamed of. Perhaps he might also throw himself into his career because he feels worthless and is trying to prove to others (and himself) that he has value. He is striving to find peace with himself and who he is.

- A woman may be utterly despondent and despairing because she is bereft of comfort for a myriad of reasons; her life is out of control and she feels helpless. She craves control and peace in her broken life–whatever the cost–so she begins cutting calories and starving herself to control and “fix” the only thing she perceives she can–herself. She wants peace with her life and herself. 

- A boy feels alone–abandoned by his mother and shamed by his father. He turns to the internet and finds solace in entertainment and endless pleasure through pornography. He has no love from family, friends, or himself, so he seeks connection through parasocial relationships: sexual and non-sexual. He has thousands of faceless friends to spend time with and an infinite supply of women who “love” him. He longs for peace and since he is not finding it in real life, he will create it himself. 

All three of these people ultimately want one thing: peace. The problem is that they think their biggest need is personal or “inner” peace with themselves and others. 

What they really need first, is peace with God. Once they are at peace with God, then they will also slowly acquire the elusive peace with their own selves and other people that they have been searching for. Not to say that this is guaranteed, in fact, often finding peace with God will actually cause you to lose quite a bit of peace–with other people and even with yourself as you begin to follow Christ, die to self, reject the world, and live amongst others who do not follow God. Gaining peace with God may not give you any of the other “types of peace” in this lifetime at all. God never promises a perfect life free of suffering and boundless peace. What He does promise is Himself and peace with and from Himself, which is all we really truly need–a peace that surpasses all circumstance, difficulty, and suffering. 
What does that look like? It is trusting God in the midst of suffering. It is knowing God and resting in the fact that you are safe: eternally justified in Him no matter what happens in this short life we have. This life is but a breath and will be full of pain, but if we have peace with God it is bearable because we know we have Him.

- Job lost everything being afflicted by Satan and did not curse God.
- William Cowper was tormented by despair and still trusted in God’s character.
- Horatio Spafford lost all but his wife and could still find peace in God. 
- David had little earthly peace but expressed his peace with God through psalms.
- Paul had a very difficult life of ministry but ran his race resting in God.
- Jesus was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, but He loved God through all.

Peace with God is dependent on one thing: God. It is not swayed by circumstance, difficulty, sorrow, affliction, suffering, torture, sickness, sin, nor death. It is peace in the deepest sense: the living faith and reality of God choosing to reconcile man back to Himself. At the end of the day, that is all that we need: God Himself. 

Of course, it is not wrong to pray for peace and relief. God desires that we pray to Him about our suffering and bring it to Him, but He may not answer your request for healing with a “Yes”. He may give you a “No” or not even give you an answer at all. He may even seem distant or completely deaf to your cries. However, He will always hear you. He will never leave you (despite feeling like He has). He will always give you Himself. We may not have peace in this life, but we can have peace with God through Christ.

Peace is never found within ourselves, but through God giving us Himself. 

> “I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. You are yourself the answer. Before your face questions die away. What other answer would suffice?”  
> -- C.S. Lewis, Till We Have Faces

> When peace like a river, attendeth my way,  
When sorrows like sea billows roll—  
Whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say  
It is well, it is well with my soul.  
> -- Horatio Spafford, It Is Well with My Soul

> Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,  
But trust Him for His grace;  
Behind a frowning providence  
He hides a smiling face.  
> -- William Cowper, God Moves in a Mysterious Way 

> Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person—though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die—but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.

> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.  
> -- John 14:27

> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.  
> -- Philippians 4:7

> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?  
> -- Romans 8:35

> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.  
> -- Ephesians 2:8-9
