Does life have value? My life? If so, why? 

Is it the amount of things I accomplish? The scope of my influence and impact? Is it rated on a scale from 1 to 10 based on good and bad actions? Perhaps it is something else altogether. The amount of years lived? Family? Importance? Fame? Usefulness?

Ask anyone and I hope that we would all agree that each human life is valuable in some way–but why? There has to be a reason. 

I’m sure that most would take the “moral” position–a life that is “valued and worthy” is reserved for people who have done the most good for others while an evil person is not. I suppose at some level even I tend to think that way even as a Christian– a faithful and holy life that glorifies God, avoids sin, and does everything for God and others is very praiseworthy and a good goal. An evil life marked by sin and hatred towards God and humanity is obviously unworthy of any commendation. 

However, a problem arises when you try to claim that faithfulness (albeit a good thing) as the basis for life having value. If this were the case, no one at all would be valuable. Paul in Romans says we are all sinners by birth and choice, so I don’t think faithfulness can be the only basis of a human life possessing worth. So what is it?

I believe Genesis gives us most of the answer, that we are creatures made in the image of God, but I don’t think that that is the entire picture either- it does not address the problem of sin. Unbelievers who don’t know God are still valuable and made in His image despite the fact they are not loved or “valued” in the same way as a believer that has been chosen by the Father. (I don’t mean that in a proud way whatsoever, just that it is abundantly clear that God loves His chosen redeemed and rejects the wicked).

With all this in mind, I would argue that a human being, no matter how good or evil, falls short of the glory and holiness of God due to their sin and stands condemned (or without value or worth) in the eyes of God, yet at the same time possessing an inherent value from being created in the very image of God. All people, “good” or “evil”, are valuable creatures who have been scarred by sin. We all need forgiveness, reconciliation, and transformation. Even the most sinful of sinners is valuable in the eyes of God because He desires that all come to Him and be saved, redeemed, and reconciled. The Father values humanity because He created them, knows what they really are supposed to be, and weeps at how they have fallen. His love then, is a piercing and transformative love that desires we be made new. 

Think of it like this - it is like a kind man who finds a stray feline in the street. The poor thing is abandoned, disheveled, and barely alive. Luckily, the man is a skilled veterinarian with a great heart for all animals. He adopts the cat, brings it to his own home, and nurses it back to health as if it was a beloved daughter. Every day for months he attended to the animal and eventually the cat was perfectly healed. The cat of course was at first very apprehensive towards the man (who in return received more than his fair share of bites, kicks, and scratches) but grew to trust in the kindness of the vet who only desired to heal and restore. The cat loved the man for the rest of its life in response to the man’s love for her. The vet saw past the brokenness and saw what the cat was originally supposed to be: healthy. 

God’s love is like this, albeit infinitely more so. He desires that we simply come to Him, be forgiven, and ultimately transformed. He wants to make us like Christ. He wants to restore us into what we were originally created to be - creatures unhindered by the disease of sin that know, worship, and enjoy God. Keep this in mind when tempted by sin. While we are yet sinners, Christ died for us so that we may be redeemed from sin. We have been and are currently being made new; remind yourself of this truth when you are tempted to indulge in the fight against sin. Let’s press on towards God and become who we were meant to be. Sin destroys, but God restores.
