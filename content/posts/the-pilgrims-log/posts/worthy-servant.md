Imagine that you are in the hall of a great and awesome king. You have been invited to freely come eat, drink, and socialize with this great one as an honored guest with many others at a grand party. You are of course excited, but also very scared and perplexed deep down; he is a dignified and awesome king and you yourself are a poor peasant. “Why would he call me of all people?”, you think. You are not a dignitary or ambassador or prince or anyone important at all. You are utterly ordinary. Surely there has been some sort of mistake. 

As you enter the great hall you see the great king who welcomes you in, but surprisingly you see no servants. You had assumed that a king would have hundreds if not thousands of servants with him tonight to manage and run this very party to serve food, pour drinks, and wait on all the guests for anything and everything. “Oh ok, he probably just wants us to handle it ourselves…that makes sense…maybe we can take turns serving him and the other guests…” you ponder. 

But with utmost surprise, the king offers you one of his precious robes. He sees that you are completely underdressed for the party (despite your best efforts being poor) and is happy to give you one. You are flabbergasted but accept it with great joy - you have never owned or worn something so valuable. 

The night continues with various surprises like this. Instead of wanting to be served, the kind king delights in serving! He joyfully overwhelms you and the other guests with the best food, drink, and gifts for everyone and never once asks to be served himself despite being the only one in the room who really deserves to be served and honored. For the evening, the king worthy of all service and praise chose to become the servant; loving and giving everything to the guests asking for nothing in return for himself.

This is the kind of humility Jesus embraced. He as God was and is worthy of everything. All worship, praise, honor, service, and glory. The worthy One did not cling to any of those things with an iron grip but set it all aside to serve the unworthy. The king became the servant. He was not snobbish or ashamed or disgusted with the lowly, sinful, weak, ashamed, or worthless, but He associated with them. These ones were the very sort of people He came to serve and love - not just partially, but wholly. He loved and served God and all of us with His heart, soul, mind, strength, and life. From the most degrading and menial task of washing dusty feet to dying in agony on a cross for us, He served us.

Friends, if the only One worthy of all worship loved and served us like this to bring us to know Him and eternal life, we also must love and serve each other in the same way. 

> Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
