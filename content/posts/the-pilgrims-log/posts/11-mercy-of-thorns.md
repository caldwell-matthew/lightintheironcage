The undeniable existence of suffering is one of, if not the hardest, biblical concepts to accept and understand. How do you reconcile the problem of suffering when a good God has created the world? Of course we can point to sin, but as we see in Job there is not a direct 1-1 correlation between sin and suffering. At a deep level, I think that all of us question why then we are allowed to suffer. 

Paul reveals to the Corinthians a very bittersweet truth about suffering and his “thorn in the flesh” - God may allow us to suffer greatly if it draws us closer to Him. 

To be honest, this verse creates many conflicting emotions within me. My visceral gut reaction to this can range from anger, sadness, or most likely just uncomforting confusion. Why would God *need* to use suffering to accomplish His purposes? However as much as this verse may be a bitter truth, it is still a truth. Strangely enough evil does have a purpose. Luther even so famously stated “the devil is God’s devil.” God allowed Satan to harass Job as well as Paul for His own purposes that they did not understand nor are we today supposed to know. That’s frankly very hard to accept. 

The only way such a heartbreaking truth is not soul-crushing is to also understand the heart of God in the midst of suffering - in the thick of it - not after healing but in the cruel hours of the night when the pain is unending. What is God’s heart in those moments when healing doesn't come and pain only increases? Where is the compassion of the Father when the son is lost? Where is the understanding of the Savior when the tears stream endlessly? Where is the comfort of the Spirit when your heart is broken, forsaken, and utterly alone?

Many times in my life I’ve asked those questions. Often I feel like they go unanswered. Sometimes I’m even tempted to believe God is indifferent to suffering. Many more times I have only been able to cry “Why?”

Despite the human temptation and assumption that God must not care, He deeply does. He cares far more than we understand. I suppose that’s part of the problem - we simply do not understand how compassionate and loving God is to us. At least I know that that is the case for me. 

Paul’s answer to suffering is the theological truth that ultimately suffering is within God’s will, and one of (if not the main) purpose of it is that we become all the more dependent on God. Through pain and trial we learn to trust God, rest in God, and cling to Him through all types of sufferings. The fire of suffering refines the “gold” of trusting God and burns the “chaff” away (sin, self reliance, etc…). 
For me knowing this truth still does not initially comfort me. It frankly makes me still doubt God’s love for me nor does it give me a restful answer. I accept Paul’s answer, but it doesn't make me feel like God understands what it is like. It’s almost like a stern “get over it” or “you need to suffer now to build character in order to come to me” kind of mentality that I can project onto God. 

Looking at Jesus however gives us a much better and biblically accurate picture of God towards the suffering: He wept with them. He embraced the lepers. He welcomed the outcasts, prostitutes, and tax collectors. He called the hungry to eat and drink. Jesus loved the hurting and delighted to not just heal them but be with them. Whatever God’s purpose is suffering, He is anything but indifferent. 

Jesus wept with Mary and Martha even though He was just about to raise his friend Lazarus from the grave. Isn't that mind-boggling? Mere moments later the cause of His friends grief would be assuaged…so why did He weep? He didn't coldly say “Don't worry about it, just wait 10 minutes.” He wept with them. That's not indifference, but pure unrelenting compassion and understanding love. 

We need both truths. God may allow us to deeply suffer in our own unique ways and at the same time weep with us in the midst of the very suffering He permits.

I really don't 100% understand this, but we don't necessarily need to. I think that most of the time Paul’s facet of truth should be examined more deeply after the suffering has ended. It is quite the opposite of loving to dismiss someone's suffering by saying “God has a plan” instead of weeping with them and pointing them to the God who also weeps with the suffering. Of course God has a plan, but we should meditate on understanding the planner far more than His plan. Paul says that his was to humble him before God but we may never know the plan at all. I can’t say why He allows some people to suffer with chronic pain nor can I say why He allows me to struggle with unrelenting depression and obsessive doubt if I am even one of His. 

I can tell you that God does have a purpose for suffering, but I will never be able to tell you exactly what it is except to draw us toward Himself. Jesus weeps with the suffering, the Father comforts the broken, and the Spirit consoles the fainthearted. Rest in that.

> So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.  
> -- 2 Corinthians 12:7–10

> Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.  
> -- Romans 5:3–5

> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.  
> -- Romans 8:28

> So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.  
> -- 2 Corinthians 4:16–18

> It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes.  
> -- Psalm 119:71

> Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.  
> -- James 1:2–4

> Jesus wept.  
> -- John 11:35

> For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.  
> -- Hebrews 4:15
