Have you ever thought to yourself, “What exactly does God want from me?” I certainly have many times in my life. The question itself is not wrong, but it can easily become wrong when asked with a sinful heart attitude. 

“What do You even want from me?!” I bitterly spit, “You’re never happy with me or anything I try to do. You’re always angry with my sin and even my best efforts to try and obey You.”

“What do You wish for me to do?” I wearily ask, “My life seems as stable as a vapor and as fragile as glass. I don't understand right now, but I want to love, trust, and obey You through it.”

It’s the same question, but the heart behind each prayer could not be further from the other.

I confess that more often than not, I am thinking in the first way – sad and bitter, depressed and confused, ashamed and broken. It’s trivial for me to assume that because God commands me to live a holy life, my failure to do so is a constant thorn in His side. I’m a problem. I’m the slave that is disobedient. I am the peppered black sheep unlike the other spotless white ones. I am not just a man doing sinful things or falling short of a standard, but I myself am wrong entirely. As such, I begin to believe that at best He is disappointed and embarrassed of me, and at worst He is vengefully angry and full of wrath at me. Thinking like this it’s no wonder I feel crushed by my sins and bitter at God. “I’m trying my best…” I weep. “But that's not good enough.” I hear whipped right back at me. Of course I’m going to naturally be despondent if I am believing God is condemning me mercilessly saying “Do more and then we’ll talk”.

But that is not God. God never says, “Do XYZ and then I will finally be happy with you.” or “Clean yourself up and then you can be near Me.” What an utterly blasphemous view of who God is that I so often believe! The Father is not like that. Nor is Jesus or the Holy Spirit. That is simply just not how God portrays Himself in Scripture. 

The heart of God has never ever been one of a ruthless judge condemning sinners, but a loving Father seeking out His sons that have been lost. In perhaps Jesus’ most famous parable of the prodigal son, we see two lost sons: one younger and one older. One who was outwardly obedient and one who was outwardly disobedient. The problem is that the outwardly obedient older brother was not loving his father just as much as the licentious younger brother. They were both hating their father. The father did not want their work, he wanted their love.

In Tim Keller’s The Prodigal God, he explains, 
> “Neither son loved the father for himself. They both were using the father for their own self-centered ends rather than loving, enjoying, and serving him for his own sake. This means that you can rebel against God and be alienated from him either by breaking his rules or by keeping all of them diligently. It's a shocking message: Careful obedience to God's law may serve as a strategy for rebelling against God.”  
> -- Tim Keller, The Prodigal God

The younger brother wanted his fathers money and freedom to indulge. The older brother wanted blessing from his father because of what he was doing for him. Neither of them loved their father as they should have – that is until the younger brother came back in repentance. 

The Pharisees knew the bible better than anyone during their day. They knew every law. From their warped perspective they followed everything to the letter, but did not love God. They loved themselves and hated everyone else. Especially the lowest of the low sinners like tax collectors and prostitutes. They were the ‘holy ones’ who followed God unlike the scum of the world.

The sinners of the day were forsaken by everyone. The lowest of the low. The dregs of society and the outcast of outcasts. Unloved, hated, and viewed as God’s rejects. Yet Jesus flocked to them instead of the religious teachers and scribes because He loved them who realized that they were sick. He loved the lost and was compassionate to the sinful wanting to be clean. 

That is why, despite how ironic it sounds, the Pharisee's own righteousness was what condemned them, not any gross sin like adultery or tax collecting, but their pride. They refused to repent and believe they needed forgiveness and healing just as much as the worst sinner. They honored God with their lips, yet hated Him and everyone else in their hearts. They tithed mint and dill and cumin yet they let the poor starve to death. They obeyed God’s written commands perfectly (in their eyes) yet locked away God’s mercy from the most needy. 

They believed the lie that one’s own works and righteousness is what gets you closer to God. They rejected and killed the kind Messiah who said, “I desire mercy, not sacrifice.” 
They hated the One who only longed for their hearts to love Him and not try to appease Him.

I have been both brothers. I have been the younger brother pursuing immorality. I have been the older brother trying to make sure God’s happy with me based on what I am doing. Both of these mindsets are wrong, yet at the same time both are forgiven and covered in Christ through faith. God wants your heart, not your list of things you have done for Him. With this in mind, in day-to-day life what does this look like to genuinely follow Christ without making lists?

It’s certainly easy to make a list of things: “Don't lust, read the bible (maybe an hour a day or more), don't get angry, pray every 30 minutes (at least) to be close to God, get up at 6am everyday to make sure you are not lazy, go to every single church service, event, or opportunity to serve (or else), work 10 hours a day, suffer and bleed to show God you are serious about making yourself better. Do more. Be more. You don’t want God mad at you do you?

A list is not wrong inherently, but the problem is the heart behind it. Lists often start out benign but then become your yardstick on how to measure God’s love for you. You trust in your works and what you are doing more than God. “I woke up at 6am today, read for an hour, worked at my job, and served my family. God is happy with me today.” “I slept in till 10:30, didn't touch my bible, barely prayed, and did not have work to do and just wasted time today. God hates me.” 

I have had both mindsets before. Both of them are wrong.
The correct mindset should be “I desire to do these things not to make God happy with me, but because He already delights in me in Christ and I get to do these things to know Him better.” Any actions made without such a mindset fall short of God’s love and are worthless. 

I can be the most spiritually disciplined person in the world and hate God. I can control myself perfectly, I read for hours, I can volunteer, I can fast, I can sacrifice, I can avoid sin, I can do good, I can do anything and everything, but completely leave God out of the picture. Likewise I can also be the most sinful and undisciplined person in the world and also hate God by not obeying His commandments and not thinking about Him at all. 

Both are wrong.

The heart that truly loves and follows God is the one trying to know and love Him. It is not to just do things to appease His wrath nor is it to do whatever you want and sin. It is to know Him. 

It is a waste to read the Bible to just “check off a God’s-happy-with-me-now box” for the day and it is also wrong to not read it at all. The heart's attitude should be “I desire to know, love, and follow the One in this Book. Studying what He has written about Himself is the tool to do that.” 

It is the person who says “I want to root out sin in my life because I love God and it prevents me from seeing Him clearly.” It is not “I want to stop lusting because God is going to condemn me to hell if I don't fix myself up and I hate how gross this makes me feel.”

It is not the heart that says “I need to stop being angry to make sure God is not angry with me.” It is the heart that repents “Lord I desire to forsake anger because when I am angry I am sinning against Your kind love. If I am angry I am either angry at You or another human You care about.”

It is the thankful heart that says “Father You loved me and gave Your Son for me. I want to follow You and obey You out of a heart that is already perfectly loved by you.” It is not the fearful heart that says “God I’m doing ABCDEFG because You say so and I have to make sure You are not going to send me to hell for the slightest infraction of anything.”

The difference is one heart is resting in faith, the other is relying on works. Works are good of course, but they are not the foundation of salvation and peace with God. It is faith in Christ. 

God desires our faithful service, but only out of a loving relationship, not as a heartless transaction to the point of perfection. We can’t be perfect, but we can be faithful. 

Perhaps the biggest problem that we sinners have is that we all in some way try to control God. We either act like the older brother and attempt to control God’s behavior with our actions or we act like the younger and attempt to disallow God to have any influence in our lives. Each flavor of the problem has the same solution: we need to come home. 

We must come home to the Father who loved us so much that He Himself mended the broken relationship by sacrificing His Most Beloved Son to bring the younger and older brothers back in. 

What God wants is your faithful love for Him. Not your works, not your sacrifices, but love.
