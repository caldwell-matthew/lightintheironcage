Who do you listen to the most? 

Your friends? Family? The people you admire most? Culture and society? A philosophy, religious code, or dogma? God? A book? Music? The Bible? Jesus?

Perhaps you are like me and struggle with listening to yourself more than anyone else.

It makes a lot of sense really. As Descartes said, “I think, therefore I am.” I, the person, am able to write these words you are reading while at the same time possessing the introspective, reflective, and critical abilities to analyze my own writing, existence, thinking, and even thinking about my own thinking. I am a thinker. I and all people were created to think and interact with the universe from a first-person existence - thankfully not in a solipsistic way, but thinking about it too much does still make me feel existentially uncomfortable. All that being said it doesn’t change the truth that I exist and that my own mind can reflect on itself on a near constant 24 hour basis. It’s no wonder why I listen to myself the most if I cannot mute my own mind very easily; it often feels impossible to hear anything else.

Luckily I don’t believe we have to. God never says to stop thinking, but to renew our thinking. To change, repair, and guide our thinking. 

To live wisely, we need to guard our hearts and minds by taking heed according to what God says in His word and follow it. We apply it to our lives to the best of our ability in every circumstance. That will result in a wise life. Here are a few examples.

If you are worried about the future you should listen to what Jesus and James say and not worry excessively about tomorrow and not plan life like you know the ultimate outcome. Trust in God’s plans instead of your own.

If you are tempted to lust or another sin that promises you happiness, remember what God says about it. Consider how the Bible says that sin lies and will only bring destruction, ruin, and the most miserable of miseries without any of the joy it promises.

If you are afflicted with sorrow, try to rest in the God who promises to never leave you.

Those are just a few examples, but it all starts with knowing what God says. Once we know what God says we can then apply it to our lives. Only then will we grow wise.

> Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  
> -- James 1:2–8

> Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  
> -- James 4:8

> Does not wisdom call?
Does not understanding raise her voice?
On the heights beside the way,
at the crossroads she takes her stand;
beside the gates in front of the town,
at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:
“To you, O men, I call,
and my cry is to the children of man.
O simple ones, learn prudence;
O fools, learn sense.
Hear, for I will speak noble things,
and from my lips will come what is right,  
> -- Proverbs 8:1–6

> And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son; listen to him.”  
> -- Mark 9:7

> Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.  
> -- Revelation 3:20
