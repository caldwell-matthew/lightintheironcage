In the 37th Psalm, David instructs us on the ever-so-common problem of “fretting” and what we are to do with it. It is more commonly known today as anxiety or worry, but to fret is actually a stronger term because it emphasizes the “all-consuming” nature of worry; even to the point of burning rage. The word comes from the Old English word _fretan_: to devour, consume, corrode, wear, or gnaw into. 

It’s a very fitting word. When I’m struggling with anxiety and fretful thoughts, they absolutely tend to eat away at my mind and grow out of control. If left unchecked, they end up leaving me with only more anxieties then I started with. 

David here is primarily talking about the temptation to fret over the wicked prospering while the righteous suffer, but the prescription is the same for anyone who frets:
1. Remember God has (and had) a plan for eternity. (v1-2)
2. Trust in God while being faithful where you are now. (v3-4)
3. Pursue God, make petitions, and wait. (v5-6)

First, we are told to not fret over the unrighteous prospering over the righteous because worldly blessings are temporary. No matter how rich, famous, or powerful a person–we all die. Every last one of us. Life is but a match struck aflame; how quickly it burns bright and smolders to ash! In a moment we will blink and realize that our life is almost over. 

Percy Shelly likewise captures this reality in his wonderful poem, "Ozymandias":
> I met a traveller from an antique land, Who said—  
“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone  
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,  
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  
And on the pedestal, these words appear:  
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”  

The rich, the poor, the wise, the simple, the saved, the unsaved, the famous, the meek, all go to the grave in the end and are forgotten by the world. In light of this, we are to trust God and remember what really matters: Himself and the eternal truths of reality. 

So secondly, we are told to trust and delight in God where we are right now. Primarily we need to be concerned with following Christ right now–not focused on the future. The text says to “do good, dwell in the land, and befriend faithfulness”. In other words, to be good and faithful stewards of our lives and glorify God where we are dwelling. When we are delighting in God, He will give us the desires of our heart. Not to say that we can get anything we want–this verse is talking about God giving us desires that align with His will. If that is so, do as Augustine famously said: “love God and do as you please”. For if you are delighting in God you are going to be doing good, avoiding sin, and pursuing God above all. Do that along with anything else you desire to do. 

Lastly with the previous verses in mind, we are told to “commit our way to the Lord, trusting in Him that He will act.” This is an important key: we are called to fret not, trust God, and commit our way to Him knowing that He is sovereign over all. Hold all plans with open hands because ultimately He is the one who will guide your life. Trust Him.

For me personally, how am I applying these verses? 

To my shame, I am a maddeningly anxious person. I am neurotic. I am sinfully prone to plunge into the deepest levels of self-obsessive anxiety, doubt, and insecurity–primarily about God and salvation, but also concerning most of life itself. I don’t say this to claim anxiety as an “irrevocable character trait”; but to honestly understand where I am at and identify where I need to grow. For me I think that it may be a lifelong struggle to replace anxious doubt with trusting faith in who God is towards me, but the first step to healing is to not worry by trusting in God. So first and foremost I need to know who God is on a deeper level and walk through life with Him relationally through prayer and His word. Only then as I grow in faith will the fretting decrease and the trust increase over time.

As I am doing this, I need to be faithful where I am right now spiritually, physically, relationally, and emotionally. I should “do good” where I am right now. This means continuing to serve at church where I can, love my family where I can, work at my job where I can, etc…

In regards to the future, while I have a lot of dreams and ideas, right now I need to focus on knowing God now. I can present my thoughts, plans, and potential goals to God knowing that He will either confirm or deny them in time. He will make it clear if I should (or can if I wish) continue in a direction or shift gears. I can trust that He will guide me–whether that is moving away or changing careers or something even more outrageous that I can trust Him.

But right now I certainly know I need to grow in not fretting by trusting Him first.

> Fret not yourself because of evildoers;  
be not envious of wrongdoers!  
For they will soon fade like the grass  
and wither like the green herb.  
Trust in the LORD, and do good;  
dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.  
Delight yourself in the LORD,  
and he will give you the desires of your heart.  
Commit your way to the LORD;  
trust in him, and he will act.  
He will bring forth your righteousness as the light,  
and your justice as the noonday.

> -- James 4:13-14
