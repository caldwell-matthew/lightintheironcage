Worship is a very tricky thing to get right because there are a near infinite number of ways that it can go wrong. Like the way of salvation; there is only one true way of worship: in spirit and truth. What does this mean? 

In spirit refers to the heart attitude of a person. Ultimately God tells us to love and worship Him in our soul, not in a specific way or place. Unlike the Israelites who came to worship at the foot of Mount Sinai or in the inner courts of the temple, Jesus tells the Samaritan woman at the well that the Father is to be worshiped in the heart. You don't need to be a specific race or in a certain place to worship Him. It is a matter of the posture of one’s internal soul and spirit towards God that is spiritual worship. 

This is why God ultimately looks upon a person’s heart. He sees the self righteous deeds of the Pharisees and the humble cry of a repentant sinner; honoring the faith of the one who is truly worshiping. He sees the rich displaying their plethora of gifts and instead regards the poor widow’s scarce coins. He wants the heart; not empty actions.

In truth refers to the “truthfulness” or “correctness” concerning who God is. Someone can follow any flavor of religion and be sincere, yet not worshiping God. Some of the nicest people you can meet on this earth may be sincere and devoted “in spirit” with their whole heart, yet directing that worship at something false. The LORD God YAWH is the one true God who is who He is. To worship correctly in truth is to worship Him alone. We need to know who He is and obey His truthful Word. This also rules out the use of idols, false gods, and graven images in the correct way we are to worship God. 

This is why someone who says “I am worshiping God” and yet acts like a devil is not really following God; for He said “If you love me you will keep my commandments”. Many pagan gods were worshiped through sex or human sacrifice; these are lies that must be rejected and cannot in any way be a way we worship God. If we are told to worship the Father in truth, we must know what truth is. To know what truth is we need to listen and study it as Jesus testified “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.”

This should encourage me that I don't need to be utterly perfect in my actions in how I live, think, and worship God because it is a matter of my heart towards Him through faith. It should also convict me of often putting more focus on actions (good and bad, internal and external) more than God Himself and my heart’s posture of love and trust towards Him as a direct response to Him. It also means that I need to continue to listen to the truth by reading and listening to the true Words of God. 

> Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”  
> -- John 4:21-24

> For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription: ‘To the unknown god.’ What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.  
> -- Acts 17:23

> And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.  
> -- Hebrews 11:6

> There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.  
> -- Galatians 3:28

> He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt: “Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”  
> -- Luke 18:9–14

> Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box, and he saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. And he said, “Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on.”  
> -- Luke 21:1–4

> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.  
> -- Ezekiel 36:26
