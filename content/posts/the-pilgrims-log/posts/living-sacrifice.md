Do you think your life has meaning? If so, what do you want to do with it? 

Sorry to spring such an existential question on you like that, but really, what do you want to do with your life? If you have never thought about it much, you certainly should. 

For those of us who have met Christ, been illuminated by the Holy Spirit, and adopted by the Father, we are given life. We have a new purpose. We who were once completely dead have been made into new and living beings - how could we not have meaning given to us as well? The Westminster Catechism has ever so famously declared that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. That is the meaning of life and eternity for a believer. So how exactly do we do that?

In heaven of course that will be easy - all sin will be banished from us forever and we will be made whole, holy, and perfect in the presence of God; finally able to praise, love, and abide in Him for the rest of infinity unhindered by sorrow, sin, and suffering. But what about on earth? What about right now?

I think that there are many ways we can do this in their own unique way, but at the end of the day we are called to live life on this earth as ambassadors for Christ. We are called to represent God. We are told to offer our own selves as a living sacrifice to God. Body and mind. Soul and spirit. Heart and might. Use your whole life - the only one you have been given. Use anything and everything that is you to love and worship God. 

But again, what exactly does that look like? For me? For you?

Well first of all, the Bible is very rarely going to give you explicit instructions on your specific non-spiritual decisions. God has given us this freedom to live life for Him and we have the ability to make independent decisions while abiding in His will. We have some leeway here. For example, you are not going to find a Bible verse that tells you whether to take “Job A” or move to a certain “Place B”. 

However, without fail, God will always tell you principles, characteristics, and wisdom on life and Himself. He will not tell you to become a baker as opposed to a teacher, but He will tell you to not worship money. His Spirit may not say whether to pursue one girl over another in marriage that you both fancy, but He will tell you that the internal character of a person is of more value than their beauty. The Father will often not tell you bluntly to stay or go, eat chips or fries, walk or run, gather or give. This is not to say that He cannot, of course He can, but in my experience it is rare. 
I think this is where the idea of a “living sacrifice” comes in. We are not called to only just make decision A over choice B to please God, but to present our entire life as a pleasing sacrifice to God. It is not a stream of “decisions”, but our entire body and mind. Jesus lived a perfect life pleasing to God not because He did A, B, C, and D on a list and was done but because He fulfilled the impossibly great commandment: “love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”.

So I pause to say this, but I imagine God not being very concerned whether, for example, you are deciding between choosing a career in finance or software. Now don’t get me wrong - God is in fact concerned and knowledgeable in every detail of our lives - but with something like this, I think He just simply gives us the choice. We need to make a prayerful and wise one as well as being quite sure that we are not intentionally sinning, but otherwise - follow Augustine and just “love God and do as you please”. Again, not to say that God does not sometimes clearly and bluntly shut doors and open windows of opportunity, but the point is He may or may not. We need to concern ourselves with knowing Christ more, loving Him, serving others, and killing sin far more.

If this is true, we need to be more like Christ. How do we become more like Christ? We learn more about Him and live wisely and fight sin. How? By being transformed slowly and slowly as our minds are renewed and steeped in Scripture. As we do this we will become more like God, more wise, more renewed in our thinking, and be able to do as Paul says, to “test” the decisions and choices that come your way. Grow in discernment. Abide in God's love. Trust in His wisdom. Then your mind and body and life will continue to blossom into a fragrant sacrifice to God. 

> I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.  
> -- Romans 12:1-5

> And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment.  
> -- Matthew 22:37-38

> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions. Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.  
> -- Romans 6:12-13

> Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.  
> -- Philippians 2:17

> Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.  
> -- Ephesians 5:1-2

> Then you shall take them from their hands and burn them on the altar on top of the burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma before the Lord. It is a food offering to the Lord.  
> -- Exodus 29:25

> The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.  
> -- Ecclesiastes 12:13
