![Christ in the House of Martha and Mary](/img/marymartha.jpg "Christ in the House of Martha and Mary - Johannes Vermeer")

> "Now as they went on their way, Jesus entered a village. And a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving. And she went up to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.” 
>
> But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion, which will not be taken away from her.”"  
> -- Luke 10:38-42

> "Yet I hold this against you: You have forsaken the love you had at first."  
> -- Revelation 2:4

I've recently been gently and sternly rebuked by Jesus in the very same ways He spoke to Martha and the Ephesians. I am ashamed; for I had come to the realization that my heart had once again cooled in its deep love for God.

It didn't happen overnight; like most sin, it crept up slowly like mold. 

Routine sets in, prayer is neglected, the Bible feels hollow (if I read at all), ever-changing emotions throw me off balance, depression overwhelms, sin ensnares, temptations harass, and the eyes of my soul slowly stop looking at God and who He is. I become blind. I stop trusting God as I should. I stop loving God as I should. I stop living as I should. I spiral - it feeds off of itself and it is horrible.

Whatever you are going through, please remember that your greatest need is to know, love, trust, and rest in God. Is that your focus and purpose in life? So often I have said that it is, but in reality how I spent my time betrays my profession. It's very easy to be entertained watching tv for 5 hours, but often very hard to pray deeply or reflect on the Bible for even 30 minutes undistracted. It's simple to get into a schedule and live life on autopilot, but quite difficult to live each day moment by moment with and for God.

Only one thing is necessary - we were made to be in relationship with God. Not just knowing about God. Not just being saved from hell. Not just stopping sin. Not just doing good things. None of these things are the main point although they are very important. 

One thing is necessary - and I confess I have not been focusing on this one thing I was made for: to know God, love God, and be known and loved by Him. I haven't been pursing Him wholeheartedly; it's no wonder why I feel so awful! I have been trying to fill my hungry soul with expensive sand instead of living bread freely given.

I want to talk to God more. I want to listen to Him more. I want to live for Him more. I want to obey Him more. I want more of Him. The greatest thing to realize is that He wants the very same thing I do. 

- He wants me to know Him. 
- He wants me to trust Him and His love. 
- He wants to be with me and I to be with Him. 
- He wants me to rest His overwhelming embrace in Christ.

How can I not relentlessly pursue this God who loves me so?

> "God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn, or the food our spirits were designed to feed on. There is no other. 
> 
> That is why it is just no good asking God to make us happy in our own way without bothering about religion. God cannot give us a happiness and peace apart from Himself, because it is not there. There is no such thing."  
> -- C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity
