What is the value of a life? 
What is a good one? 
What is a bad one? 
What is a wasted one?
What is a fulfilled one?

[The Secret Life of Walter Mitty](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/) has a 7.3 stars on IMDB and a (71% user / 52% critic) percentage rating on RottenTomatoes. This tells me that very few people actually understood this movie's message. 

Granted this movie is not a masterpiece, but it is certainly not anything less than a solid "B". I loved it. It is a very touching look at humanity and the value of life.

Walter Mitty is a massive introvert. A daydreamer always escaping into his imaginary version of the world. He works in a cold basement for Life Magazine editing photo negatives of far more interesting lives than his own. His imagination and his reality are blurred together and cross back and forth because he is unsatisfied with life. Talk about a relatable temptation.

I won't be recapping the whole movie, but essentially he is forced to step outside of his daydreams and into the beautiful world of reality. He's got a lot on his plate--his job at Life Magazine is about to be over if he does not find one missing #25 photo cell from legendary photographer Sean O'Connell, he needs to dance around his cruel new boss until he finds it, and maybe just maybe finish making his eHarmony account! 

Long story short he gets to live his dreams. He travels the world, meets new people, finds love, learns lessons, all the good things a protagonist needs to do to grow. I know that doesn't sound super original, but the reason why this movie is great to me is because of two scenes: the snow leopard scene and the ending. 

1. The Snow Leopard

Walter finally catches up to Sean right in the middle of his efforts to capture a photo of a rare snow leopard--"the ghost cat". 

However something interesting happens: he chooses to not take the photo. He just gazes at the leopard. Walter is rightly confused and asks him when he is going to take the shot. Sean replies,

> "Sometimes I don't. If I like a moment--I mean me--personally--I don't like to have the distraction of the camera. I just want to stay in it."
> -- Sean O'Connell

What follows is just them sitting in near silence just looking at the leopard--fully present in that little moment in time.

As much as technology has been a boon to humanity, I fear it has done so much more harm than good. The act of living has become a product--content to generate views and attention. Look at YouTube and you will see thousands of daily vlogs. Glance at Instagram or Facebook and be enchanted with lives greater than your own. Look at tourists at the Grand Canyon using their phones to take pictures or be on TikTok rather than just bask in nature.

The poet Wordsworth once said, "We murder to dissect". Today we are no different. Instead of considering the lilies, we post about them. In doing so we miss the entire point. How can we stare at the beautiful cosmos and only see black? How can we stand before the might of a mountain and see a rock? We take a picture of a bird yet forget it's Maker. We spend thousands on the perfect wedding and try to immortalize it in ink instead of just being. With technology we call ourselves gods and make it our aim to capture lightning in a bottle rather than simply gaze at it's grand power. We are superficially absent minded. We have forgotten how see God as the Author of all. He made these things to show Himself and His glory. (Colossians 1:16)

2. The End: 'The Quintessence of Life'

Walter eventually recovers the missing photo cell and submits it to his boss without actually seeing what the photo is. In fact the whole movie he has only been told by Sean that it is "the quintessence of life" whatever he means.

At the very end of the movie, he comes across the very final issue of Life Magazine: "_Dedicated to the People Who Made It_" with **himself** as its cover photo. He is gobsmacked. 

This ending is a masterpiece. The meaning of this movie is that Walter's life was inherently valuable **before he ever did any of the crazy things he did in this movie**. The photo of him was taken before he even started on his adventure.

His life was valuable even though it was often unseen, unappreciated, overlooked, and uninteresting. He spent most of his time in a dark basement developing photos. The photographer Sean was world renowned and famous, yet was not proud. He understood the beauty and value of the ordinary faithful life lived. 

Such it is with God, albeit infinitely more so. He does not value lives on a scale of "usefulness" or "fame" but instead loves us because He made us. God loves us because He has chosen to in Christ. He cares not whether you are a prince or a pauper nor if you are famous or forgotten. He sees you and values you. (Genesis 1:27)

What a wonderfully biblical and beautiful truth. 

> “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”  
> -- Jeremiah 1:5

**Rating: B** : A great movie on the value of an "ordinary" life.

Why should I make this channel?

No, genuinely—I’m asking you—why should I make this YouTube channel?

I’ve been tossing this idea back and forth in my brain for some time now, and I’ve come to a point where I just need to make this one video and let God and the internet decide what happens from here.

I’m battling two very different mindsets right now.

The first one is self-deprecating:
“Why on earth would people want to listen to you? What do you even have to offer? There are far more godly, talented, and wise voices than yours. Yes, you’re a Christian—but why talk about literature, art, anime, music, movies, and TV? Shouldn’t you just talk about the Gospel? Are you even going to make a difference? Why you?”

The second mindset is more hopeful:
“God made you as a unique person. No one else is 100% like you. God saved you and loves you—so why not talk about Him as revealed in everything? People, saved or unsaved, need to be pointed to God. You can help do that. All true beauty—whether found in art, music, books, or visual storytelling—ultimately point to the One Master Storyteller, the source of all beauty: God. If you can help others see that… why stay a silent voice?”

So again, dear viewer, I must ask: Should I make this channel?
Does YouTube really need another Christian voice?
More specifically... does it need mine?

For example, would you want to hear me talk about how the animated movie Your Name is one of the most beautiful films I’ve ever seen—and how it echoes the biblical ideas of providence, predestination, and our deep human longing to be known?

Is that something you’d want?
Tell me. Or maybe... don’t.
Maybe this isn’t about answers. 
Should I even be asking you? 
Am I just insecure and should do it anyway?

I’m no one special. I’m just a Christian—a sinner God chose to love. I’m not a preacher. I’m not a Bible scholar. I’m just an ordinary man.

As I record this, I’m 30 years old. And the older I get, the more I wonder what I could possibly offer—to God, to anyone else... or even to the entire internet. Honestly, I feel very lost right now.

Maybe that’s why I’m making this video—to cast a line out and see if there’s any potential interest in what I could share.

I’d love to talk about books, music, anime, TV, movies—all the places I hear the whispers (and sometimes shouts) of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. I just honestly don’t know at this point if that would help anyone—Christian or non-Christian, skeptic or believer.
But maybe it might.

I believe that every eternal truth, every little flower, every sound, every animal, every pure and beautiful thing has God's fingerprints etched upon it. I just want to help you see that.

Do you?
