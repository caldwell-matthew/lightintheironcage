What do you want most?

Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean (PoC) trilogy (I know there are technically 5 movies now but I categorize the first three as one cohesive story) is just straight up goofy fun with amazing characters all around. 

Jack Sparrow (our lovable hero) is a legend, Davy Jones is a tragic yet threatening villain, William and Elizabeth grow in deep love, James Norrington falls from grace but chooses a side, Barbosa and the other pirates are scoundrels but at the same time have a deep sense of honor, and the British East India Trading Company is domineeringly self-righteous. I love it. It's just so enjoyable to watch all of these characters.

PoC is also not afraid to explore the supernatural with each movie having a tie into myths, legends, curses, and the unexplainable mystery of the world around them. There are undead pirates, ghost stories, legends, Davy Jones' Locker, monsters, witches, and powerful enchanted artifacts. 

Jack Sparrow's compass is one of them. It's unique. Jack explains,

> "True enough, this compass does not point north."  
> "...It points to the thing you want most in this world."  
> -- Jack Sparrow

That sounds simple right? It's not flashy. It's not overly impressive at first glance. It's even mocked by many of the characters because it just looks like a broken compass. 

But to Jack and the other characters who know what it is, it is priceless. The reasoning is that if it points to the thing you want most, it can point to anything and everything. Nothing you want can be hidden from you because you will always be able to make your way to it eventually... right?

However what is so fascinating about it the compass is that it is unreliable by it's own definition-it points to what you want most. What if you don't know what you want? Emotions and 'wants' are fickle. Jack himself in the movies even gets frustrated with it at times when he is feeling deeply conflicted. 

For a Disney movie, that is an incredibly poignant message to propose. So often a mantra of Disney is to "always follow your heart" or "be true to yourself"--but how do you even do that? Can you? Is your heart infallible, never changing, and always pointing in the right direction? My heart and emotions are certainly not.

> The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?  
> -- Jeremiah 17:9

If I followed what I wanted most in every single moment, I would be dead. If I trusted my heart above all else, I would be heartbroken. If I loved whatever my emotions wanted at any given time, I would be spinning in thousands of differing directions. 

Like Jack's compass, our emotions and the direction of our affections are tools. They may be pointing North, but they also may be pointing South. Ironically our free will is often not a blessing, but a curse. We don't have a natural clear direction or sure footing to stand on. We have our hearts to guide us and are therefore lost. 

This is why we need God. We need Him to direct our lives and orient our hearts to Him. He is the Way, the Truth, the Life. We need to follow Him, not our own deceitful hearts that want thousands of trinkets an hour.

We can trust God that He will be our compass to life.

> Jesus said to him, â€œI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.  
> -- John 14:6

**Rating: B** : A feel-good trilogy of piracy with surprising depth.
