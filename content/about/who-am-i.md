## Hi, I'm Matthew.

### Who I Am
Ultimately, I am nothing but a helpless sinner that God graciously chose to love. 

I was a professing Christian since 2013, but fell away into deep apostasy during the 2019 COVID pandemic, and truly met the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for the first time in late 2023. 

I did not find God, He chose and found me (Jeremiah 31:3, Luke 15:20, John 6:44, 15:16, Romans 10:20, Ephesians 2:17, 1 John 4:10). If you want to hear the full story, check out my baptismal testimony of His faithfulness to me below.

It is simply not possible to quantify or fully explain the depth of God’s patience and love towards me, so I would like to just briefly summarize how He has been merciful to me.

I was a professing Christian at this very church for many years, but severely fell away in apostasy around 2019 on account of a myriad of sins, issues, doubts, and false beliefs that had only grown and grown over time. I had spiraled so far down in mental despair that I resolutely believed that either the entirety of Christianity is not true, or if it was true that God only made me to be condemned in my sin. I lived each day under a weight of damnation. To me there was either no God at all or only a god of infinite wrath.

I was like the man in the iron cage as John Bunyan described in Pilgrim’s Progress, trapped under the knowledge of sin, but no sense of any hope of God’s love. Charles Spurgeon put it this way: “They are sensitive of their guilt, but powerless to believe that the crimson fountain can remove it: they are alive only to sorrow, despondency, and agony. Sin paralyzes them with despair. …they cannot believe it; they cannot rejoice, they cannot cast themselves on Jesus; they are utterly without strength.” That was me. 
I pray that none of you listening have walked on such a road. Thank God earnestly if you have not, for I cannot imagine a worse fate upon a living person: to believe you are already in hell, forsaken by God.

I continued like that for years until the proper time when God chose to reveal Himself to me. He chose to love me when I had done nothing but abandon Him. As Paul referenced Isaiah in Romans 10:20, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
And as John 15:16 says, “You did not choose me, but I chose you.” He showed me that night that I was indeed separated from Himself and was indeed utterly lost in my sin and unbelief, but that He was more utterly loving and merciful than I had ever dreamed. He was real and wanted to know me. I poured over biblical articles and scripture, and was graciously shown who God actually is: Father, Son, and Spirit. 

1 John 4:10 wonderfully declares that, “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” My sin of unbelief was even more utterly sinful than I had comprehended in my despair - I was sinning against a God of love, not hate. He granted me repentance by His Spirit, Jesus life and death, and His Fatherly love. I did nothing but bring my sin and joyfully respond in repentant faith that He also gave me. My sins were many, but His mercy was more. 

Repentance is not just feeling sorrow and hopeless despair over sin. True repentance leads a sinner to rest and trust in God. Not in a vague sense, but in a life-altering sense. Knowledge of sin and God will do you no good at all if you don't respond in your emotions and volitional will. You need all three. Neither will it help you to just do the right things with no emotional heart. We were saved to love God and be loved. Anything that leads you away from delighting in God who has loved you, loving Him, and loving others, is completely missing the point. I finally understand what it means that Christianity is not a religion, but a living and vibrant relationship with a God who loved me first and adopted me into His family. 

I’ll close with this quote from C.S. Lewis: “The great thing to remember is that, though our feelings come and go, His love for us does not. It is not wearied by our sins, or our indifference; and, therefore, it is quite relentless in its determination that we shall be cured of those sins, at whatever cost to us, at whatever cost to Him.” I stand here as one relentlessly loved forever by a living God in spite of my sin.

My goal in life is God Himself; to love and be loved by Him. I want everything and everything I do in life to go towards that.

> Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same."   
> -- C.S. Lewis, Mere Christianity

Since being saved, I have just been learning how to live in light of God's love and follow Him. While I am confident God has saved me, I still frequently and deeply struggle with doubt, assurance, depression, OCD/scrupulosity, and my overall mental health. 

I am naturally a very melancholic and introspective person, and at this point I am convinced that this struggle is indeed my "thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 12:7-10) that will remain with me until I meet Christ. As I walk through life I pray that I can better learn how to use my strengths for God's glory and avoid the many pitfalls of melancholy. Some days are good, some days are bad, but God is good. 

> “But though natural likings should normally be encouraged, it would be quite wrong to think that the way to become charitable is to sit trying to manufacture affectionate feelings. Some people are ‘cold’ by temperament; that may be a misfortune for them, but it is no more a sin than having a bad digestion is a sin; and it does not cut them out from the chance, or excuse them from the duty, of learning charity.”

### What I Do
With this goal in mind, I want to work and play for the glory of God. 

As for work, I currently am a software developer since I obtained my bachelors in computer science, but it is not really a passion of mine. It mainly pays the bills and is fun (at times) to problem solve. This blog is one way I want to use my educational background to get my thoughts out there to potentially help other people know more about God and how to walk through life with Him through suffering and splendor. I also need to preach truth to myself daily and think on truth! You can read all about my thoughts on the Christian life and meaning in [The Pilgrim's Log](/lightintheironcage/posts/the-pilgrims-log/).

As for play, I deeply love music, books, and other forms of visual storytelling! They are precious gifts from the Father.

I listen to music constantly, play electric guitar, and write my own music. A big dream of mine is to become a professional musician. Lord willing, I would relish the opportunity to make music for God. My taste in music is a blend of metal/rock/prog with Christian/thoughtful themes. I have many beloved bands and music that I love to talk about in [The Ensemble](/lightintheironcage/posts/the-ensemble/). 

As for literature, since coming to faith my love of books was reunited. How could it not? The Bible is a book. Life itself is a storybook God has written. I have many favorite books and authors (especially anything by the great C.S. Lewis) which I love to talk about in [The Library](/lightintheironcage/posts/the-library).

As for other media I enjoy movies, tv, and anime. Just like with music and books I tend to be drawn to anything that explores very religious, philosophical, or poignant themes/ideas. I have found many stories (particularly anime) that have some of the most utterly beautiful stories pointing to our human longing for God or some other biblical truth. Check out my thoughts in [The Cinema](/lightintheironcage/posts/the-cinema).

Thanks so much for listening; I hope my writing can be helpful to point you to God.
