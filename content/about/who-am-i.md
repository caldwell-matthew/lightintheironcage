## Hi, I'm Matthew.

### Who I Am
Ultimately, I am nothing but a helpless sinner that God graciously chose to love. 

I was a professing Christian since 2013, but fell away into deep apostasy during the 2019 COVID pandemic, and truly met the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit for the first time in late 2023. 

I did not find God, He chose and found me (Jeremiah 31:3, Luke 15:20, John 6:44, 15:16, Romans 10:20, Ephesians 2:17, 1 John 4:10). If you want to hear the full story, read my baptism testimony of His faithfulness to me.

My goal in life is God Himself; to love and be loved by Him. I want everything and everything I do in life to go towards that.

> Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same."

Since being saved, I have just been learning how to live in light of God's love and follow Him. While I am confident God has saved me, I still frequently and deeply struggle with doubt, assurance, depression, OCD/scrupulosity, and mental health. I am a very melancholic and introspective person and salvation typically does not change a person's temperament. At this point I am convinced that this struggle is indeed my "thorn in the flesh" (2 Corinthians 12:7-10) and will remain with me until I meet Christ. As I walk through life I pray that I can better learn how to use my strengths for God's glory and avoid the many pitfalls of melancholy. Some days are good, some days are bad. Through them all God is good. 

> “But though natural likings should normally be encouraged, it would be quite wrong to think that the way to become charitable is to sit trying to manufacture affectionate feelings. Some people are ‘cold’ by temperament; that may be a misfortune for them, but it is no more a sin than having a bad digestion is a sin; and it does not cut them out from the chance, or excuse them from the duty, of learning charity.”

### What I Do
With this goal in mind, I want to work and play for the glory of God. As for work, I currently am a software developer since I obtained my bachelors in computer science, but it is not really a passion of mine. It mainly pays the bills and is fun (at times) to problem solve and code stuff. This blog is one way I want to use this educational background of mine to get my thoughts on paper to potentially help other people know more about God and how to walk through life with Him through suffering and splendor. I need to preach truth to myself daily! You can read all about my thoughts on the Christian life and meaning in [The Pilgrim's Log](/posts/the-pilgrims-log/).

As for play, I deeply love music and books! They are precious gifts from the Father.

I listen to music constantly, play electric guitar, write my own music, and big dream of mine is to become a professional musician. Lord willing, I would relish the opportunity to make music for God. My taste in music is a blend of metal/rock/progressive with Christian/poignant themes. I have many beloved bands and music that I love to talk about in [The Ensemble](/posts/the-ensemble/). 

As for literature, since coming to faith my love of books was reunited. How could it not? The Bible is a book. Life itself is a storybook God is writing. I have many favorite books and authors (especially anything by C.S. Lewis) which I love to talk about in [The Library](/posts/the-library).
