## Critical Matters
Please note that while this portion of my statement of faith has been copied from [GotQuestions.org](https://www.gotquestions.org/faith.html), the ultimate authority is God Himself as revealed in the Bible.

### Section 1: The Bible
We believe the Bible, comprised of the Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God (Matthew 5:18; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). We believe the Bible to be inerrant in the original writings, God-breathed, and the complete and final authority for faith and practice (2 Timothy 3:16-17). While still using the individual writing styles of the human authors, the Holy Spirit perfectly guided them to ensure they wrote precisely what He wanted written, without error or omission (2 Peter 1:21).

### Section 2: God
We believe in one God, who is Creator of all (Deuteronomy 6:4; Colossians 1:16), who has revealed Himself in three distinct Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (2 Corinthians 13:14), yet who is one in being, essence, and glory (John 10:30). God is eternal (Psalm 90:2), infinite (1 Timothy 1:17), and sovereign (Psalm 93:1). God is omniscient (Psalm 139:1-6), omnipresent (Psalm 139:7-13), omnipotent (Revelation 19:6), and unchanging (Malachi 3:6). God is holy (Isaiah 6:3), just (Deuteronomy 32:4), and righteous (Exodus 9:27). God is love (1 John 4:8), gracious (Ephesians 2:8), merciful (1 Peter 1:3), and good (Romans 8:28).

### Section 3: Jesus Christ
We believe in the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is God incarnate, God in human form, the express image of the Father, who, without ceasing to be God, became man in order that He might demonstrate who God is and provide the means of salvation for humanity (Matthew 1:21; John 1:18; Colossians 1:15).

We believe that Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary (Matthew 1:23); that He is truly fully God and truly fully man (John 1:1,14); that He lived a perfect, sinless life (1 John 3:5); that all His teachings are true (John 14:6). We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for all humanity (1 John 2:2) as a substitutionary sacrifice (Isaiah 53:5-6). We hold that His death is sufficient to provide salvation for all who receive Him as Savior (John 1:12; Acts 16:31); that our justification is grounded in the shedding of His blood (Romans 5:9; Ephesians 1:7); and that it is attested by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Matthew 28:6; 1 Peter 1:3).

We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven in His glorified body (Acts 1:9-10) and is now seated at the right hand of God as our High Priest and Advocate (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25).

### Section 4: The Holy Spirit
We believe in the deity and personality of the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:3-4). He regenerates sinners (Titus 3:5) and indwells believers (Romans 8:9). He is the agent by whom Christ baptizes all believers into His body (1 Corinthians 12:12-14). He is the seal by whom the Father guarantees the salvation of believers unto the day of redemption (Ephesians 1:13-14). He is the Divine Teacher who illumines believers' hearts and minds as they study the Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:9-12).

We believe that the Holy Spirit is ultimately sovereign in the distribution of spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11). We believe that the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, while by no means outside of the Spirit’s ability to empower, no longer function in exactly the same manner they did in the early development of the church (1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians 2:20; 4:7-12).

### Section 5: Humanity
We believe that humanity came into existence by direct creation of God and that humanity is uniquely made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27). We believe that all humanity, because of Adam’s fall, has inherited a sinful nature, that all human beings choose to sin (Romans 3:23), and that all sin is exceedingly offensive to God (Romans 6:23). Humanity is utterly unable to remedy this fallen state (Ephesians 2:1-5,12).

### Section 6: Salvation
We believe that salvation is a gift of God’s grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross (Ephesians 2:8-9). Christ’s death fully accomplished justification through faith and redemption from sin. Christ died in our place (Romans 5:8-9) and bore our sins in His own body (1 Peter 2:24). On the third day after His death, Jesus physically rose again, demonstrating His victory over sin and death (Romans 14:9).

We believe salvation is received by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. Good works and obedience are results of salvation, not requirements for salvation. Due to the greatness, sufficiency, and perfection of Christ’s sacrifice, all those who have received Christ as Savior are eternally secure in salvation, kept by God’s power, secured and sealed in Christ forever (John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Romans 8:1, 38-39; Ephesians 1:13-14; 1 Peter 1:5; Jude 24). Just as salvation cannot be earned by good works, neither does it need good works to be maintained, sustained, or preserved. Good works and transformed lives are the fruit of the salvation that God has secured (Galatians 5:22-23; James 2:14-26).

### Section 7: The Church
We believe that the Church, the Body of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of all believers of this present age (1 Corinthians 12:12-14; 2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 1:22-23, 5:25-27). We believe in the ordinances of believer’s water baptism by immersion as a testimony to Christ and identification with Him, and the Lord’s Supper as a remembrance of Christ’s death and shed blood (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42, 18:8; 1 Corinthians 11:23-26). Through the church, believers are to be taught to obey the Lord and to testify concerning their faith in Christ as Savior and to honor Him by holy living. We believe in the Great Commission as the primary mission of the Church. It is the obligation of all believers to witness, by word and life, to the truths of God’s Word. The gospel of the grace of God is to be preached to all the world (Matthew 28:19-20; Acts 1:8; 2 Corinthians 5:19-20).

### Section 8: Angels and Demons
We believe in the reality and personality of angels. We believe that God created the angels to be His servants and messengers (Nehemiah 9:6; Psalm 148:2; Hebrews 1:14).

We believe in the existence and personality of Satan and demons. Satan is a fallen angel who led a group of angels in rebellion against God (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:12-15). He is the great enemy of God and man, and the demons are his servants in evil. He and his demons will be eternally punished in the lake of fire (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).

### Section 9: Things to Come
We believe in the blessed hope (Titus 2:13), the personal and imminent coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to rapture His saints (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). We believe in the visible and bodily return of Christ to the earth with His saints to establish His promised millennial kingdom (Zechariah 14:4-11; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; Revelation 3:10, 19:11-16, 20:1-6). We believe in the physical resurrection of all human beings—the saints to everlasting joy and bliss on the New Earth, and the wicked to eternal punishment in the lake of fire (Matthew 25:46; John 5:28-29; Revelation 20:5-6, 12-13).

We believe that the souls of believers are, at death, absent from the body and present with the Lord, where they await their resurrection when spirit, soul, and body are reunited to be glorified forever with the Lord (Luke 23:43; 2 Corinthians 5:8; Philippians 1:23, 3:21; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). We believe that the souls of unbelievers remain, after death, in conscious misery until their resurrection when, with soul and body reunited, they shall appear at the Great White Throne judgment and shall be cast into the Lake of Fire to suffer everlasting punishment (Matthew 25:41-46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-26; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9; Revelation 20:11-15).

## Non-Critical Matters
This portion of my statement of faith reflects my own personal views as informed by God, His word, and my own observations. Not all of my views may be agreed upon by my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ and that is perfectly fine. We are allowed to have disagreements, but please disagree with me in a biblical way. Like all humans, I am fallible. Test what I say and believe with what the Bible says. If I am in the wrong, I want to know why and how according to the word of God. Feel free to shoot me an email.

### Section 1: Common Grace
I believe in God's kindness expressed upon all humanity (redeemed and unredeemed) in the form of "Common Grace" that touches upon all aspects of life for all to enjoy (Matthew 5:45, Psalm 145:9, Luke 6:35).

### Section 2: Mental Health
I believe in the spiritual and physical realty of mental health as result of the fall. 

The moment Adam and Eve sinned, the world was cursed and began to decay (Romans 8:21-22) along with our bodies (Genesis 3:19, Ecclesiastes 12:7). The mind is part of the body and can be afflicted with multiple issues like depression, OCD, anxiety, PTSD, autism, and more. The idea that mental illness does not exist is not only bad theology, but incredibly harmful and dismissive to those who suffer from it. 

One day all will be made new (1 Corinthians 15:51-55), but until then we must press on towards healing from God Himself first and foremost in His word and in prayer. We should also pursue, as the Puritan Richard Baxter calls it, "a thorough healing", through the utilization of supplemental "Common Grace" helps of doctors, counselors, therapists, medications, and other scientific advancements. Did not Paul console Timothy to partake in physical helps for his stomach? (1 Timothy 5:23) Are we to tell the suffering to simply just pray away their chilling misery when there is the slightest chance medicine could help? (James 2:15-17) Can we be so heartless as to berate the cancer patient for getting chemotherapy? How is it any different for diseases of the mind? Would not the sufferer be justified in condemning us as utterly miserable comforters? (Job 16:2, 6:14-27)

However, I also believe that mental illness is never an excuse for a person's actions, nor should be embraced as an identity. The diagnosis of mental illness and the application of counseling, medication, and so forth can be abused and misused without addressing any potential spiritual issues. This is indeed a reality that we need to be careful of. Regardless, _abusus non tollit usum_ - "abuse does not take away proper use." The truly suffering soul may be (and often is) helped and healed by God through the application of doctors, psychology, medication, psychiatry, diet, counseling, accountability, and therapy. Lest we in our pride be like the fool in "The Parable of the Drowning Man" and spurn God's practical and physical mercy, let us use the gifts God has provided while trusting in Him above all. 

Even the great theologian John Calvin writes, 
> “Therefore, in reading profane authors, the admirable light of truth displayed in them should remind us that the human mind, however much fallen and perverted from its original integrity, is still adorned and invested with admirable gifts from its Creator. If we reflect that the Spirit of God is the only fountain of truth, we will be careful, as we would avoid offering insult to him, not to reject or condemn truth wherever it appears…. If the Lord has been pleased to assist us by the work and ministry of the ungodly in physics, dialectics, mathematics, and other similar sciences, let us avail ourselves of it.”
> 
> -- John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion

At best, mental health denial is a deep misunderstanding of the reality of sin, the fall, and its effects upon physical humanity. At worst, it is borderline heretical; drifting towards the Prosperity Gospel. Or perhaps even more accurately: the _Mental Health Prosperity Gospel_.

I recognize the fact that many Christians disagree with this, even truly theologically sound ones that I respect. Some I may still even reference on this blog as a good resource for mental illness because they are very apt at talking about the potential spiritual root causes behind such struggles like depression or OCD. This does not mean I 100% agree with everything they say. Many Christians are simply just flat out wrong when it comes to mental health. I am thankful for their insights and wisdom, but in this matter they are not seeing the whole picture. My advice to my fellow sufferers is to snatch up the diamonds of truth within and shake off any dust you may encounter. Even if no one else in the world may understand, Jesus does. He knows, loves, and cares for you (Matthew 11:28-30). Rest in Him.

### Section 3: Politics
I believe politics have become a major idol and a false hope for many today, and should not be a major focus or hope in the believer's life (1 Corinthians 2:2, Philippians 3:8-10). I follow the one true King of Kings and Lord of Lords and hold no loyalty to any political party. We need to be ambassadors for Jesus Christ and promote the gospel, not advance a political agenda - even biblically-based ones. We need to tell all people: the politician, the poor, the king, and pauper the exact same message (Acts 26:26-29). God alone is who we need to promote as the only hope. Jesus Himself was not concerned with earthly politics much at all except in the obedience to them (Matthew 22:17–22, John 6:15), unless of course it causes a person to sin (Acts 5:29). When we choose to focus on political worries and party squabbles, we cheapen the message of the gospel, divide the Church, damage our witness to the lost, and take the focus off of the true eternal King. 

As such, I also reject the idea of voting for "the lesser of two evils" to blindly promote any political party or politician that "aligns closest to biblical principles" in the two-party system. 

C.S. Lewis warned of this very mindset in his political essay, "Meditation on the Third Commandment" from _God in the Dock_,

> "It is not reasonable to suppose that such a Christian Party will acquire new powers of leavening the infidel organization to which it is attached. Why should it? Whatever it calls itself, it will represent, not Christendom, but a part of Christendom. The principle which divides it from its brethren and unites it to its political allies will not be theological. It will have no authority to speak for Christianity; it will have no more power than the political skill of its members gives it to control the behavior of its unbelieving allies. 
>
> But there will be a real, and most disastrous, novelty. It will be not simply a part of Christendom, but a part claiming to be the whole. By the mere act of calling itself the Christian Party it implicitly accuses all Christians who do not join it of **apostasy and betrayal**." (emphasis mine)
> 
> -- C.S. Lewis, God in the Dock

This being said, I think we should _try_ to vote faithfully and biblically as God directs our conscience to the best of our ability to restrain evil in the world and promote the most good. Regardless of what happens, God is sovereign (Daniel 2:20-22, John 19:11).

### Section 4: Interpreting End Times
I believe that every generation is tempted to believe that the end is near. I do not think it is wise to spend time obsessing over, interpreting, or trying to predict details of the future end times based on current events (Matthew 24:36, Mark 13:32) while neglecting the present. The end has always been near ever since Jesus rose from the dead.
