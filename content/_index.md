Light in the Iron Cage was created, above all, to serve as a personal testimony and praise to the mercy and kindness of my God, Savior, and Friend - Jesus Christ. As He has shown me gentleness and pursued me with unrelenting love, I desire to articulate my own thoughts and experiences in the hopes that God may use them for His glory to help those in need: the suffering, the despairing, the depressed, the hopeless, the numb, the addicted, the poor, the broken, the lost, the sinful, and those who feel trapped within an [**Iron Cage.**](https://kenpulsmusic.com/pilgrimsprogress28.html) 

I pray to my Father that through His Holy Spirit, He might use this humble blog of mine to save, comfort, exhort, challenge and edify any soul who stumbles upon it. I pray for you, dear reader, that it may be so for even you. Amen.
