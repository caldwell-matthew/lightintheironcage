> "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”  
> -- Matthew 11:28-30

## Books

### Mere Christianity

> "Most people, if they had really learned to look into their own hearts, would know that they do want, and want acutely, something that cannot be had in this world. There are all sorts of things in this world that offer to give it to you, but they never quite keep their promise.
>
> If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is that I was made for another world.
>
> Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that other country and to help others to do the same."  
> -- C.S. Lewis

### Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers

> "That God is rich in mercy means that your regions of deepest shame and regret are not hotels through which divine mercy passes but homes in which divine mercy abides. It means the things about you that make you cringe most, make him hug hardest. It means his mercy is not calculating and cautious, like ours.
>
> It is unrestrained, flood-like, sweeping, magnanimous. It means our haunting shame is not a problem for him, but the very thing he loves most to work with. It means our sins do not cause his love to take a hit. Our sins cause his love to surge forward all the more. It means on that day when we stand before him, quietly, unhurriedly, we will weep with relief, shocked at how impoverished a view of his mercy-rich heart we had."  
> -- Dane C. Ortlund

### Morning and Evening

> "Let me encourage you in His name to diligently search and solemnly test your spiritual state, for fear you should come short of the promised rest. This is what every wise man does, and what God Himself does with us all."  
> -- Charles H. Spurgeon

### Spurgeon's Sorrows

> "Many of us feel that if we were more true to Jesus we wouldn’t struggle this way. Others actually tell us earnestly that our salvation in Jesus is threatened and put into question. But just as a man with asthma or a woman born mute will likely remain this way even though they love Jesus, so our mental disorders and melancholy inclinations often remain with us too.
>
> Conversion to Jesus isn’t heaven, but its foretaste. This side of heaven, grace secures us but doesn’t cure us. "There are lines of weakness in the creature which even grace does not efface." Though substantial healing can come, Charles reminds us that often it waits till heaven to complete its full work."  
> -- Zack Eswine

### The Pilgrim's Progress

> “This hill, though high, I covet to ascend;  
> The difficulty will not me offend.  
> For I perceive the way to life lies here.  
> Come, pluck up, heart; let's neither faint nor fear.  
> Better, though difficult, the right way to go,  
> Than wrong, though easy, where the end is woe.”  
> -- John Bunyan

### The Lord of the Rings

> "The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater."  
> -- J.R.R. Tolkien
